# Welcome to My GSoC 2025 Blog!  

Hi! Iâ€™m Mithun, a Google Summer of Code 2025 contributor with Zarr. This blog will document my progress as I work on implementing a **bit-packing shuffle filter** to optimize storage for scientific datasets.  

## Week 0: Preparation  
- Studied Zarr V3 specs and ADC data storage challenges.  
- Set up development environment locally.  

Stay tuned for updates!
